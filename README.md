# Expo Camera Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Camera` component where applying certain styles causes the camera preview to fail to render correctly. The issue is primarily related to conflicts between custom styles and the component's internal layout management.  The `bug.js` file reproduces the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem:

The camera preview fails to display as expected. This may manifest as a blank screen, a distorted image, or other visual anomalies.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully considering the styling of the parent container and ensuring it doesn't interfere with the `Camera` component's ability to manage its own layout.  The corrected version provides a more suitable approach to styling and layout.

This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom styles.  If you apply styles that conflict with the default behavior of the Camera, the camera preview might not render correctly or might display unexpected behavior, such as a blank screen or a distorted image. This is especially common when using flexbox properties like `flex: 1` without careful consideration of the parent component's layout.
